## Architecture Approach  

Scalable AI-native systems follow a structured design:

Frontend (React / Next.js)  
→ Backend API Layer (Express / Microservices)  
→ AI Orchestrator (LangChain / Agents)  
→ LLM / Fine-tuned Model  
→ Vector Database (RAG)  
→ Monitoring + CI/CD  

Built for reliability, scalability, and measurable business impact.
